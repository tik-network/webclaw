# Changelog

All notable changes to webclaw are documented here.
Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/).

## [0.1.1] — 2026-03-24

### Fixed
- MCP server now identifies as `webclaw-mcp` instead of `rmcp` in the MCP handshake
- Research tool polling caps at 200 iterations (~10 min) instead of looping forever
- CLI returns non-zero exit codes on errors (invalid format, fetch failures, missing LLM)
- Text format output strips markdown table syntax (`| --- |` pipes)
- All MCP tools validate URLs before network calls with clear error messages
- Cloud API HTTP client has 60s timeout instead of no timeout
- Local fetch calls timeout after 30s to prevent hanging on slow servers
- Diff cloud fallback computes actual diff instead of returning raw scrape JSON
- FetchClient startup failure logs and exits gracefully instead of panicking

### Added
- Upper bounds: batch capped at 100 URLs, crawl capped at 500 pages
